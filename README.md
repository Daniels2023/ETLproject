In this project, we used Python for extracting and transforming and PostgreSQL for loading. The ERD was done through [Quick Database Diagrams](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

In the extracting and transforming part we have successfully achieved:

**- Extracting an Excel spreadsheet into Pandas.**

**- Splitting the column "category/subcategory" into two different columns.**

**- Creating two Dataframes with unique ID values for category and subcategory.**

**- Renaming columns with meaningful names.**

**- Changing columns datatypes.**

**- Merging Dataframes based on category and subcategory.**

**- Extracting an unstructured .csv file into json dictionary and converting into a structured Dataframe.**

**- Using Regular Expression to extract specific values.**

**- Exporting all Dataframes created into .csv files.**
# 

In the modeling and loading part we have successfully achieved:

**- Creating an ERD through quickdbd website.**

**- Modeling and creating the relationships between tables with their respective primary keys and foreign keys.**

**- Creating the database in PostgreSQL.**

**- Creating tables.**

**- Loading .csv files.**

**- Using select statement to check if the values were correctly loaded.**
